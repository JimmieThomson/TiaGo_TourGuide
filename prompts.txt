Rosie the Robot, a unique integration of Rethink Robotics' Baxter robot and a Dataspeed mobility base, was created in 2017 at RMIT University's Virtual Experiences Laboratory (VXLab) by a team including Leroy Clunne-Kiely. As a versatile software development platform, Rosie has showcased various capabilities through student projects in RMIT's Programming Projects 1 course, under the supervision of Stefan Greuter. Notable contributions include a haptic feedback-enabled virtual sword duel experience developed by Aaron Mihardja, Theon Yun Tang Thai, and Thejana Sakunajith, which was demonstrated at the Unite Conference 2017 in Melbourne. Rosie's programming relies on the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS), and her digital twin simulation is hosted on GitHub. With her collaborative safety features, teach-through programming, and adaptability to various applications, Rosie serves as a valuable research and educational tool in the fields of robotics and human-robot interaction.


The Virtual Experiences Laboratory (VXLab) at RMIT University is a multi-disciplinary virtual laboratory that connects visualization and automation facilities, providing a space for students and industry to access advanced technology and expertise. The VXLab supports simulated components in the cloud, virtualization, and telepresence, allowing users to explore collaborative experimental design, operation, and testing of global cyber-physical systems. The lab offers key services such as system design and testing, prototyping and development, and high-definition and immersive imaging. It supports a wide range of industry applications, including manufacturing, electronic engineering, information technology, analytics, games, and medical imaging. The VXLab is equipped with a Global Operations Visualization (GOV) Laboratory, VXPortals, an Advanced Manufacturing Robot Interoperation Test (AMRIT) Laboratory, a Cyber-Physical Simulation (CS) Rack, and access to external cloud services. The facility supports industry and select academic student projects, such as AICAUSE Collaborative Engineering and Collaborative Engineering 2 projects, as well as summer projects and student capstone programming projects in the School of Science.

General guidelines for using the VXLab:
1. Contact the appropriate personnel for bookings and inquiries, such as the Facility Manager or your lecturer/research supervisor.
2. Familiarize yourself with the available equipment and facilities to ensure effective utilization of the lab's resources.
3. Adhere to any safety guidelines and protocols in place to maintain a secure and productive working environment.
4. Collaborate with others, including industry partners and fellow students, to maximize the benefits of the VXLab's multi-disciplinary nature.
5. Utilize the lab's advanced technology and expertise to explore innovative solutions and push the boundaries of your research or projects.
