Rosie the Robot, created in 2017 at RMIT University's Virtual Experiences Laboratory (VXLab), is an integration of a two-armed Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics and an omnidirectional Dataspeed mobility base. Rosie has served as a versatile software development platform for student projects, showcasing features such as haptic feedback, speech recognition and synthesis, computer vision, and human-robot interaction. Programmed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and with a digital twin simulation hosted on GitHub, Rosie has made appearances at events like the Unite Conference 2017 in Melbourne. In one notable project, students integrated Rosie with a virtual reality system to provide tactile feedback in a sword duel experience. Rosie's collaborative safety measures, teach-through programming, and open-source foundation make her an valuable asset for research and education in robotics and human-robot interaction.
