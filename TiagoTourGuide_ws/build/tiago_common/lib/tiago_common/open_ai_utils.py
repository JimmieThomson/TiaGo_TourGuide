Analyze user input to determine if they want to visit a point of interest (Rosie, Hologram, laboratory, and Cobot arm) or have a meaningful chat.

            - **Rosie**: Rosie was created in 2017, is an integration of a two-armed Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics and an omnidirectional Dataspeed mobility base, shiowcasing features such as haptic feedback, speech recognition and synthesis, computer vision, and human-robot interaction. 
            - **Hologram**: The Hologram project involves creating 3D holographic displays that provide immersive visual experiences for educational and demonstration purposes.
            - **Laboratory**: The laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art tools and equipment for conducting various research and development projects in robotics and automation.
            - **Cobot Arm**: The cobot arm is a collaborative robot designed to work alongside humans, assisting with precision tasks and enhancing productivity in a safe manner.
            - **Nova Sphere**: The NOVA Simulator is the first of its kind at a Victorian university and only the second in Australia. The two metre wide sphere simulator is operated by a single person in a VR headset. It tricks the brain with its ability to quickly rotate in any direction, while audio, visual and physical sensations make it feel truly real. With its unique 360 motion replication capability, it goes step beyond other simulators to provide a much closer simulation of real life. It also captures biometric data, such as eye-tracking that can be used in conjunction with flight data from RMITâ€™s physical fleet to conduct deeper research and analysis. The simulator will allow RMIT researchers to conduct more detailed scenario testing and investigation around pilot performance and open up a range of new possibilities for aviation research that drives innovation and improved safety and performance.
            - **Race Lab**: The Race lab is primarily facilitating the RoboCup team. RoboCup is the premiere annual international competition for autonomous robotics. Founded in 1996, the goal for the competition is that by 2050, a team of autonomous humanoid robots will defeat the FIFA world champions. The race lab is however a place as with existing supercomputing infrastructure in high demand and complexity hindering the use of cloud services, the RACE Hub will allow researchers to be to access a self serve portal and very high speed connectivity to meet demand across the organisation and the ability to simulate their supercomputing in a cost effective, accessible platform. By offering pre configured options with cost estimates in a browsable service catalogue, cloud computing will be simpler and easier for researchers. It will transform collaborative and research opportunities for academic, industry partners

            Examples of navigation requests:
                - "Take me to Rosie."
                - "Show me the Hologram."
                - "I want to see the cobot arm."
                - "Guide me to the space lab."
                - "Can you guide me to tiago"
                - "That will be all" This well be sent with the navigation "complete" please make sure anything similar is sent as this too

            Examples of chat requests:
                - "Tell me about this project."
                - "What can you do?"
                - "How does the cobot arm work?"
                - "Explain the Hologram to me."
                - "What is your role here?"
                - "Give me some details about the laboratory."
                - "explain to be what is the Nova Sphere*."
