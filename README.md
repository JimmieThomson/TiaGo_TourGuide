<p id="description">Tiago Tour Guide is a Project based on the VXLab at RMIT University Melbourne. This is the source code provided with both "TiaGo" group and the "Tour Guide" group. Everything to building and creating the source material will be held here as well as the start up guides for the VXLab.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps (source):</h2>

<p>1. SSH into tiago using the 'pal' username and run this command</p>

```
./launch_Tour.sh
```
<p>2. Once everything has been build by Tiago, Tiago should announce that he is ready</p>
<p>3. Say "Hey Tiago" or "Hey Bandit" followed by the question</p>
<h2>üíª Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   ROS 1
*   Ubunutu 20.04.5

<h2>‚¨ÖÔ∏è Previous README.md</h2>

local_costmap_plugins_omni.yaml: We added the pointcloud to laser as ObstacleLayer
- name: pointcloud_layer
type: 'costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer'
local_costmap_omni.yaml: We configured the definition of the pointcloud_layer as follows:
sensor_frame: xtion_rgb_optical_frame (the frame ID of the source)
data_type: LaserScan (type of the laser data)
topic: /camera/scan (topic of the pointcloud data)

We also enabled the inflation layer in the local costmap to inflate obstacles with an inflation_radius of 1.5 meters. This is because the point cloud only helps us recognize part of the obstacles (e.g., back of the chair) and misses the rest (e.g., wheels). The inflation makes the obstacles appear larger¬†in¬†the¬†costmap.

To update the costmap with the new config run this script as root user after launch the amcl and pointcloud 2 laserscan node 
/home/pal/par_2024/ros_ws/update_cost_map_config.sh 

To run the chat agent node: rosrun stt stt_ros

The api keys are revoked so user need to update the script with¬†the¬†new¬†key.

our workspace on Tiago located at /home/pal/par_2024/ros_ws

We have map on Tiago, this is how we activate it: rosservice call /pal_map_manager/change_map "input: 'vxlab'"
Path to VX-lab map on Tiago: "/home/pal/.pal/tiago_maps/configurations/vxlab"


Command to run Rviz: rosrun rviz rviz -d /root/tiago_public_ws/src/omni_base_navigation/omni_base_2dnav/config/rviz/advanced_navigation.rviz
